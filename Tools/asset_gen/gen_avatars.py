"""
CCP asset generator — avatar sets (and reusable for future batches).

Generates a consistent 4-pose character avatar set with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
("nano banana"), then post-processes each frame to match the Conditioning Control
Panel sprite format exactly:

    PNG, RGBA, transparent background, tightly cropped to subject, HEIGHT = 194 px.

Consistency strategy (per task spec):
  * POSE 1 is generated text->image and becomes the MASTER character image.
  * POSES 2-4 are generated image->image, passing POSE 1 back as a reference with
    an edit instruction so the woman/outfit/palette/lighting stay identical and
    only the pose + expression change. Nano banana is strong at this.

This script makes NO changes to the app, mechanics, or any mod folder. It only
writes generated images to its own output/ directory for review.

Usage:
    python gen_avatars.py --batch kept            # generate the Keeper set
    python gen_avatars.py --batch kept --dry-run  # build prompts, no API calls
    python gen_avatars.py --batch kept --no-rembg # skip rembg, use PIL fallback

Key loading order (never printed):
    1. --env-file PATH (if given)
    2. .env files probed at the locations in ENV_CANDIDATES below
    3. process environment: GEMINI_API_KEY / GOOGLE_API_KEY / GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY
