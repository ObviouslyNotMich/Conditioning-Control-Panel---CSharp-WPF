# Avalonia Migration Task Board

Master task list derived from `docs/crossplatform-rebuild-plan.md` and the detailed breakdowns produced by planning sub-agents.

> **Swarm execution:** this board is the live work queue for a multi-agent swarm. **Read
> `docs/crossplatform-rebuild-plan.md` §20 (Multi-Agent Swarm Execution & Context Discipline) before
> claiming or assigning anything.** Claim work via the **Active Claims Ledger** below — do **not** hand-edit
> the same file as another agent, and never touch a §20.1 chokepoint from a porter lane (route those changes
> through the Hand-off Queue to the orchestrator).

## Legend

- **Priority:** `P0` blocker · `P1` critical path · `P2` parallelizable · `P3` polish/final parity.
- **Status markers** (used in the ledger and, optionally, inline on a phase item):
  - `⬜ todo` — unclaimed, available to pick up.
  - `🚧 wip @agentN` — claimed / in progress by `agentN`.
  - `🔵 review` — complete in a worktree, awaiting orchestrator integration.
  - `✅ done` — merged and the integration build is green.
  - `🚫 blocked` — see the ledger Notes column.

---

## Swarm Coordination

> Single source of truth for *who is doing what right now*. Mirrors plan §20.4. Prefer **appending rows**
> over editing scattered list items — appends rarely conflict; in-place edits across the board do.

### Active Claims Ledger

Append a row to **claim**; the orchestrator marks `✅ done` and removes the row after a clean integration build.

| Lane (owned subtree) | Item | Owner | Status | Branch / worktree | Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CCP.Core/App.cs` + Core `App.X` call sites | Remove/rename Core `App` stub so WPF can reference Core and delete model copies | — | `🚫 blocked` | see plan §19.4 | 2026-06-21 |
| `CCP.Avalonia/Views/Deeper/DeeperEditorWindow` | Timeline drag-create/resize regions, effects, haptics + rubber-band multi-select | orchestrator | `🚧 wip` | `main` | 2026-06-21 |
| `CCP.Avalonia/Views/Deeper/DeeperEditorWindow` | Browser preview + audio waveform cache + curve editor | — | `⬜ todo` | `main` | 2026-06-21 |

### Hand-off Queue (porter → orchestrator)

When a lane reaches `🔵 review`, append an entry here. The orchestrator applies the chokepoint changes
(DI, csproj assets, loc merge), merges, builds, then deletes the entry.

### Claim protocol (mirror of plan §20.4)

1. **Claim:** add your ledger row with `🚧 wip @agentN` and **commit that row first** (cheap "claim commit")
   so concurrent agents see it. Don't start an item that already has a `🚧`/`🔵` row.
2. **Work:** stay inside your lane's subtree (plan §20.1). If you need a chokepoint change, **do not edit it** —
   write it into the Hand-off Queue.
3. **Review → integrate:** set the row to `🔵 review`, fill the Hand-off Queue, hand the worktree to the
   orchestrator. The orchestrator integrates, sets `✅ done`, and clears the row.

---

## Phase 0 — Cleanup (P0)

1. ✅ Remove dead packages (`SharpDX.*`, `OpenAI-DotNet`, `OllamaSharp`) — done; removed from all projects (0 references).
2. Verify and remove unused `MahApps.Metro` / `IconPacks` references.
3. ⚠️ **Corrected — do NOT remove `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`.** It is a required transitive of LibVLCSharp; pin it with `ExcludeAssets="all" PrivateAssets="all"` to avoid a WebView2 `NU1605` downgrade (see plan §5.1).
4. Delete `CopyLibVLCAfterPublish` and `IncludeWebView2LoaderInPublish` from shared project; move to Windows head later.
5. Add platform analyzers and remove `CA1416` `NoWarn` once cross-platform seams are in place.
6. Document feature matrix (portable vs. Windows-only) in `docs/platform-feature-matrix.md`.

---

## Phase 1 — Carve Out `CCP.Core` (P0)

### Main Shell & Dashboard

4. ✅ Port Settings/Dashboard tab view (velvet mosaic grid + right panel) — **DONE**.
5. Finish `MainWindow.axaml` code-behind parity (drag-drop, resize grips, window state, XP bar, banner).

## Current Sprint Focus

§19.3 main-merge backlog is complete: `AppSettings`, `Fredoka`, `UpdateService`, service-deltas, `ChaosCrashSentinel`, `ChaosBoonColors`, shared-host overlays, `ChaosSkiaFxOverlay`, and the full `BubbleService` overhaul (ambient + chaos variants + field hazards + shared-host + global mouse hook) are ported. The §19.4 project-reference collapse remains blocked; see plan §19.4.

Chaos overlay integration is complete and build/test green: cursor-glow/banner/field-FX animations, `AvaloniaChaosWindowZ` topmost re-assert, full countdown → descent → spawn → scoring → draft → results lifecycle, meta persistence, `RevealService`, boon runtime, focus economy, active toys, lessons, narrative director, and happy-path scripting are in `main`.

AvatarTube behavior restoration is complete (speech/AI chat/Circe emotes/reactions/windowing/fullscreen detection/context-menu toggles/emotive portrait system).

Deeper runtime engine, dispatcher, and host are now in `CCP.Core`; the Avalonia player binds the engine via `AvaloniaLibVlcTimeSource`. A functional basic `DeeperEditorWindow` (metadata, regions/rules/haptics lists, save, preview) replaces the placeholder. `GazePickerWindow` is ported and wired for gaze-target/avoid rect authoring. The full WPF visual timeline, curve editor, browser preview, and `AudioWaveformCache` remain.

Next priorities (pick one lane at a time):

1. **Deeper editor depth** — full visual timeline editor parity (drag-create/resize regions, curve editor, browser preview, `AudioWaveformCache`). This is a large slice; sub-split before starting.
2. **Phase 4 UI parity smoke-test** — run the Avalonia desktop app and fill `docs/avalonia-ui-parity-matrix.md` gaps.
3. **Phase 4 remaining work** — port WPF-only dialogs/utility windows and wire feature-control code-behind.
