    /// Why: the app keeps many WS_EX_LAYERED / AllowsTransparency top-level windows alive at once, and
    /// each owns a DWM composition surface. When the main window crosses onto a monitor with a different
    /// DPI, WPF synchronously rebuilds every visible window's composition surface (the
    /// HwndTarget.UpdateWindowSettings/OnShowWindow path). If a fresh flash/bubble window is *also*
    /// created in that same window (or overlays are torn down and recreated), the burst of surface
    /// allocation can exhaust desktop-heap / GPU-committed memory — the "Not enough quota is available"
    /// crash — or wedge the render thread (the freeze on monitor move). See the freeze-cluster diagnosis.
    ///
    /// This does NOT stop existing windows from being rebuilt (WPF owns that); it just avoids ADDING new
    /// layered surfaces during the volatile window right after a display change. Callers that skip a
    /// spawn simply drop one transient effect — invisible to the user, and everything resumes ~1s later.
